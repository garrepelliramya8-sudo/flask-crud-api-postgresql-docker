# 🚀 Getting Started

Follow the steps below to run this project on your local machine.

## 1. Prerequisites

Before running the project, install:

* Git
* Docker Desktop
* Postman (for API testing)
* TablePlus (optional, for database testing)

Make sure Docker Desktop is running before executing the Docker commands.

---

# 2. Clone the Repository

Open your terminal or PowerShell and run:

```bash
git clone <YOUR_GITHUB_REPOSITORY_URL>
```

For example:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/flask-crud-api.git
```

Move into the project directory:

```bash
cd flask-crud-api
```

---

# 3. Check the Project Files

The project should contain:

```text
flask-crud-api/
│
├── app.py
├── requirements.txt
├── Dockerfile
├── docker-compose.yml
└── README.md
```

---

# 4. Start PostgreSQL

Run the PostgreSQL container:

```bash
docker compose up -d flask_db
```

The `-d` option runs the container in detached mode.

Check the running containers:

```bash
docker compose ps
```

You should see the PostgreSQL container running.

You can also check the logs:

```bash
docker compose logs flask_db
```

Look for a message indicating that PostgreSQL is ready to accept connections.

---

# 5. PostgreSQL Database Configuration

The PostgreSQL container uses the following configuration:

```text
Host: localhost
Port: 5432
Username: postgres
Password: postgres
Database: postgres
```

The database is stored using a Docker volume so that the PostgreSQL data can persist.

The PostgreSQL service is defined in `docker-compose.yml`.

---

# 6. Optional: Connect Using TablePlus

You can use TablePlus to check the PostgreSQL database.

Create a PostgreSQL connection with:

```text
Host: localhost
Port: 5432
User: postgres
Password: postgres
Database: postgres
```

Test the connection.

If the connection is successful, PostgreSQL is running correctly.

> TablePlus is optional. You do not need TablePlus to run the Flask API.

---

# 7. Build the Flask Docker Image

From the project directory, run:

```bash
docker compose build
```

This command builds the Flask application Docker image using the `Dockerfile`.

You can check the available Docker images using:

```bash
docker images
```

---

# 8. Start the Flask Application

Run:

```bash
docker compose up -d flask_app
```

You can check the containers using:

```bash
docker compose ps
```

You should have both services running:

```text
flask_app
flask_db
```

---

# 9. Check Flask Application

The Flask application runs on:

```text
http://localhost:4000
```

The test endpoint is:

```text
GET http://localhost:4000/test
```

Open the URL in your browser or test it using Postman.

Expected response:

```json
{
    "message": "test route"
}
```

If you receive this response, the Flask application is running successfully.

---

# 🔄 CRUD API Endpoints

The application provides the following endpoints.

| Operation     | HTTP Method | Endpoint      |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| Test API      | GET         | `/test`       |
| Create User   | POST        | `/users`      |
| Get All Users | GET         | `/users`      |
| Get User      | GET         | `/users/<id>` |
| Update User   | PUT         | `/users/<id>` |
| Delete User   | DELETE      | `/users/<id>` |

The complete base URL is:

```text
http://localhost:4000
```

---

# 📝 1. Test API

### Request

```http
GET http://localhost:4000/test
```

### Expected Response

```json
{
    "message": "test route"
}
```

---

# 📝 2. Create a User

### Request

```http
POST http://localhost:4000/users
```

In Postman select:

```text
Body
→ raw
→ JSON
```

Example request body:

```json
{
    "username": "ramya",
    "email": "ramya@example.com"
}
```

Click **Send**.

A new user will be stored in PostgreSQL.

You can create multiple users by sending different requests.

---

# 📝 3. Get All Users

### Request

```http
GET http://localhost:4000/users
```

This returns all users stored in the PostgreSQL database.

Example:

```json
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "username": "ramya",
        "email": "ramya@example.com"
    }
]
```

---

# 📝 4. Get a Specific User

To retrieve one user, provide the user's ID.

### Request

```http
GET http://localhost:4000/users/1
```

Replace `1` with the required user ID.

Example:

```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "username": "abc",
    "email": "abc@example.com"
}
```

---

# 📝 5. Update a User

To update an existing user:

### Request

```http
PUT http://localhost:4000/users/1
```

In Postman:

```text
Body
→ raw
→ JSON
```

Example:

```json
{
    "username": "abc_updated",
    "email": "abc_updated@example.com"
}
```

Click **Send**.

The selected user's information will be updated.

You can verify the update using:

```http
GET http://localhost:4000/users/1
```

---

# 📝 6. Delete a User

To delete a user:

### Request

```http
DELETE http://localhost:4000/users/1
```

Replace `1` with the ID of the user you want to delete.

After deleting the user, verify it using:

```http
GET http://localhost:4000/users
```

The deleted user should no longer appear in the list.

---

# 🐳 Docker Commands

### Start all services

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Start only PostgreSQL

```bash
docker compose up -d flask_db
```

### Start only Flask

```bash
docker compose up -d flask_app
```

### Build the application

```bash
docker compose build
```

### Check running containers

```bash
docker compose ps
```

### View application logs

```bash
docker compose logs flask_app
```

### View PostgreSQL logs

```bash
docker compose logs flask_db
```

### Stop the containers

```bash
docker compose down
```

---

# 🗄️ Database Persistence

PostgreSQL uses a Docker volume:

```text
pgdata
```

This volume stores the PostgreSQL database data outside the temporary container filesystem.

Therefore, removing and recreating the containers does not automatically remove the stored database data.

To remove the containers **and** database volume:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

> ⚠️ Use `docker compose down -v` carefully because it removes the PostgreSQL volume and therefore deletes the stored database data.

---

# 🔧 Environment Configuration

The Flask application connects to PostgreSQL using the `DB_URL` environment variable.

Inside Docker Compose, the database connection uses the PostgreSQL service name:

```text
flask_db
```

The connection follows this format:

```text
postgresql://postgres:postgres@flask_db:5432/postgres
```

Important:

Inside Docker, use:

```text
flask_db
```

instead of:

```text
localhost
```

because the Flask container communicates with the PostgreSQL container through the Docker network.

   Create another user

4. GET /users
   Check all users

5. GET /users/1
   Check one user

6. PUT /users/1
   Update user

7. GET /users/1
   Verify update

8. DELETE /users/1
   Delete user

9. GET /users
   Verify deletion
```

# 🛠️ Troubleshooting

## Docker is not running

If you see an error similar to:

```text
failed to connect to the docker API
```

make sure **Docker Desktop is running** and then try:

```bash
docker compose ps
```

---

## Check whether containers are running

Run:

```bash
docker compose ps
```

You should see:

```text
flask_app
flask_db
```

with a running status.

---

## Check Flask logs

If the API is not responding:

```bash
docker compose logs flask_app
```

---

## Check PostgreSQL logs

If Flask cannot connect to the database:

```bash
docker compose logs flask_db
```

---

## Restart the project

You can restart everything with:

```bash
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
